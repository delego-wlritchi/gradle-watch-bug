This repository demonstrates an issue with Gradle continuous builds.

In one terminal:

$ ./gradlew classes -t
Continuous build is an incubating feature.
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:inner
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 1.649 secs

Waiting for changes to input files of tasks... (ctrl-d to exit)



In another:

$ touch src/main/webapp/nested

Gradle fails to notice the change, and does not rerun the inner task.
